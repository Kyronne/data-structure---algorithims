<div><h1>Big O</h1>
<p>Big O encourages us to understand what code is most efficent, utilising time complexity - runs in the shortest amount of time.
Space complexity is another way of utilising BigO, which is solving a problem in less code/less memory usage.

<p>
    Big O signifies worst case
    Best case and least number if iterations is represented by Omega
    Average case is represented by Theta
